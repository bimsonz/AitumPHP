# AitumPHP

AitumPHP is a simple library that provides an easy way to interact with the Aitum public API.

If you are looking to write custom Actions that can be triggered by the Aitum app then checkout
the [AitumPHP Custom Code Framework](https://github.com/bimsonz/AitumPHP-cc).
This framework provides a simple framework for defining, registering and executing custom action written in PHP.

Full documentation for this library is still under construction.
